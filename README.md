# SOEN6111-BIG-DATA
Project background: Understand the relationship between the production input parameters and results of a certain imported instrument in the factory, and conduct data prediction and sensitivity analysis.

Theoretical basis: According to the production process of a certain imported instrument in the factory, a one-year data set formed by capturing a set of data every 15 minutes for analysis. According to five data input sources and one output source, data modeling is performed, and then the latest The input factors in the actual production process of one month are tested and predicted, and the accuracy of the model establishment is proved by comparison with the true value curve.
